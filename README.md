This project is the first of three portfolio projects I am currently working on. I am new to development and if you read the code I'm sure that will be quite clear! This is a pretty simple project; it'd a node.js backend that uses [desmondmorris's excellent twitter library](https://github.com/desmondmorris/node-twitter). I use socket.io to stream tweets in realtime to the front end. They are categorized as geo or non-geo by the backend and handled accordingly on the front end.

Overall it's a pretty simple project designed to show my ability to piece together a few libraries to create something meaningful.

ps. the title and port number I chose are related, see if you can figure out how!

##The Hate Map

This is a component of a larger project of mine; The Hate Map.  The goal is to display hate speech from social media with a mix of real time and search based data.  I'm currently only using Twitter as the API is very accessible and well documented.  This is an important project to me because I think we get away with a lot of poor speech due to the anonymity of the internet.  Privacy is a very, very important subject to me and part of that is the responsibility of what you do with that privacy.  Our words have real impact whether we see it or not.  When I first started this project I was shocked by the sheer amount of legitimate hate speech that come through my console.  It ranged from casual, profane jabs between friends to viscious and unsettling language.  I hope you'll take a look at the finished project once it's done and contribute your commentary on whether you are affected by some of the things you come accross online.

Thank you!
