This project is the first of three portfolio projects I am currently working on. I am new to development and if you read the code i'm sure that will be quite clear! This is a pretty simple project, it'd a node.js backend that uses desmondmorris's excellent twitter library. I use socket.io to stream tweets in realtime to the front end. They are categorized as geo or non-geo by the back and and handled different on the front end.

Overall it's a pretty simple project designed to show my ability to piece together a few libraries to create something meaningful.

ps. the title and port number I chose are related, see if you can figure out how!
